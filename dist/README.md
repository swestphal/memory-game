# Memory Game

Train your brain with this memory game!
[play it here](http://memory.swestphal.net/)

## Getting Started

In Order to run the game you only need the app-folder.

In this game, you have to select 2 matching cards. After two cards, the pairing is checked.

You can select the level on the left panel. After starting the game it is not possible to change the level. In order to change the level after a game has started you have to push "new game" on the right panel.

If your browser supports datasaving on local storage, your moves, the played fieldsize, time and rating of the last six games will be saved.

Let's play and have fun!
